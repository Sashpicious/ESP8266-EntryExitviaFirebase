# ESP8266-EntryExitviaFirebase

This project that I have developed for my Final Year Project. It consists of an ESP8266, Servo motor and the PN532 NFC module. The ESP8266 will be sending and receiving data from a Firebase Realtime Database. The Realtime Database is also linked to an NFC application that enables users to turn their NFC android phones into an access card. The card ID will be linked to each user and the ESP8266 will check each card ID if it is registered or not.
